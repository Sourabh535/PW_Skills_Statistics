    "# 1. Nominal scales\n",
    "# Qualitative and Categorical data. Order does not matter. In nominal scales, the numbers assigned to each variable or observation are only used to classify the variable or observation. For example, a fund manager may choose to assign the number 1 to small-cap stocks, the number 2 to corporate bonds, the number 3 to derivatives, and so on.\n",
    "# 2. Ordinal scales\n",
    "# Order is important. In ordinal scales, there is an ordered relationship between the variable’s observations. For example, a list of 500 managers of mutual funds may be ranked by assigning the number 1 to the best-performing manager, the number 2 to the second best-performing manager, and so on.\n",

Range: It is the length of the smallest interval which contains all the data and is calculated by subtracting the smallest observation (sample minimum) from the greatest (sample maximum) and provides an indication of statistical dispersion.

Because of its dependance on just two observations, it tends to be a poor and weak measure of dispersion, with the only exception being when the sample size is large.\n"
